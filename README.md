Audio and covers not included due to space and copyright.

The player is desiged to work with a data array containing the routes to all versions of the audio (mp3, ogg and wav), checking which of those is the best option for the current browser.
It uses local storage to save the song, time and volume you were listening before the window was closed, as well as your favorites.
